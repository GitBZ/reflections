When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

    There are many reasons one would do this:
    • for collaboration (especially non-colocated)
    • to be able to work on the same project from different machines
    • to pass deliverables between human teams from one phase to
      another (e.g., from design & frameworking, to development & unit
      testing, to code review, to formal QC review & testing, etc.)
    • for backup/redundancy
    • to share a project's source code in the spirit of open-source,
      simply as a model or as a contribution to the collective art

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
